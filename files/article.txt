Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw its India-made iPhone shipments jump as total U.S. smartphone volumes surged 30% year-over-year in March amid a tariff-avoidance rush, Counterpoint Research reports. OEMsincluding Apple, Samsung (SSNLF) and Motorolahurried inventory into the U.S. ahead of April 2 tariffs, driving U.S. inventories up 51% year-over-year for the month.

India's share of U.S. smartphone shipments climbed to 26% in Q1, from 16% a year ago, with Motorola nearly tripling its India output and Samsung leaning on its Indian Galaxy A16 line. China's share dipped to 52% from 56%, while Vietnam fell to 21% from 27%, underscoring a broader shift in production mix.

Apple's sell-in jumped 42% in March as it pre-stocks U.S. channels, compared to Samsung's more modest 4% gain, thanks to Samsung's diversified supply base and midyear device lineup.

Counterpoint Senior Analyst Gerrit Schneemann notes the March build-up will help insulate Apple from immediate pricing impacts through mid-to-late summer, and predicts that if U.S.China tariffs remain unresolved by the iPhone 17 launch, India will become the primary source for U.S.-bound units.

Over the weekend, Washington and Beijing agreed to slash reciprocal tariffsU.S. cuts from 145% to 30% and China from 125% to 10% for 90 daysoffering a temporary reprieve that Samsung hopes will avert price hikes.

Why It Matters: Shifting production to India and front-loading shipments may shield Apple from tariff headwinds, while broad inventory builds signal how OEMs are hedging policy risk in global supply chains.

Investors will be watching April shipment data and tariff negotiations over the next 90 days to see if India's role solidifies and pricing pressure eases.
